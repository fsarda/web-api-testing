# web-api-testing

This repo is just a playground for some web api's and techs i want to try out.

Each folder is an example.

Written in vanilla JavaScript + html + css

To try out all examples on this repo root folder run `npm install; npm run all:examples` and by default you'll be opening the web worker version (http://127.0.0.1:8080/) with the list of examples available.

So far we have examples for:
- [Web worker to solve massive client logging](./web-worker-for-massive-client-logs/README.md)
